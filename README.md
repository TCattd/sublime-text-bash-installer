Sublime Text 3 Ubuntu/Linux Bash Installer

A *really* simple bash installer for Sublime Text 3.
The bash script will check www.sublimetext.com/3, auto-grab the lastest build url, download, unpack, install and create a .desktop file... all in one step.

## USAGE:
```
sudo bash st3install
```

This can be used to upgrade and existing Sublime Text 3 installation made by the same script.
No more upgrade worries ;)
